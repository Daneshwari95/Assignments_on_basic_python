In any programming language, an expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators. So that if there is more than one operator in an expression, their precedence decides which operation will be performed first. \n    \n   There are different types of expression:\n   1. Constant Expressions: These are the expressions that have constant values only.\n   2. Arithmetic Expressions: An arithmetic expressionis a combination of numeric values, operators, and sometimes parenthesis. \n   3. Integral Expressions: These are the kind of expressions that produce only integer results after all computations and type conversions.\n   4. Floating Expressions: These are the kind of expressions which produce floating point numbers as result after all computations and type conversions.\n   5. Relational Expressions: In these types of expressions, arithmetic expressions are written on both sides of relational operator (> , < , >= , <=).\n   6. Logical Expressions: These are kinds of expressions that result in either True or False.",
